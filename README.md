# Markdown Editor
## Learning Outcomes:
In this project, I had the opportunity to practice a wide range of Python concepts and techniques, including:

* List operations
* File handling
* Functions and scopes
* Lambda functions and the filter function
* String manipulation and formatting

Additionally, I became familiar with the markdown language and its various tags and structures.

## About the Project:
Markdown is a popular plain text formatting language widely used by developers, researchers, and documentation writers. It offers a simple and efficient way to format text documents, including creating headers, lists, emphasis, and links.

In this project, I built a markdown editor that allows users to input text and apply markdown formatting. The editor is capable of recognizing and rendering various markdown tags and structures. Furthermore, it provides the functionality to save the formatted output to a file, enabling users to easily create well-formatted documents.

This markdown editor project served as an excellent opportunity to combine my Python skills with my understanding of the markdown language, resulting in a practical and valuable tool for developers, writers, and anyone working with text-based documentation.
